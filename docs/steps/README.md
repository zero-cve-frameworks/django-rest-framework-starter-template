# Steps - How This Repository Was Built

This document outlines the step-by-step process of building this Django REST Framework starter template.

## 1. Initial Django Project Setup

Created the base Django project:

```bash
django-admin startproject core .
```

## 2. Created Base App

Created the base app and moved it to `apps/` directory:

```bash
python manage.py startapp base
mkdir -p apps
mv base apps/base
```

Updated `apps/base/apps.py` to use `apps.base` naming convention.

## 3. Created API App

Created the API app to organize and expose API endpoints:

```bash
python manage.py startapp api
mv api apps/api
```

Updated `apps/api/apps.py` to use `apps.api` naming convention.

## 4. Configured REST Framework

Added Django REST Framework dependencies and configuration:

- Added `rest_framework`, `rest_framework_simplejwt` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Configured JWT authentication in `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings
- Set up `SIMPLE_JWT` configuration with 30-day token lifetime

## 5. Added CORS Support

Configured CORS for frontend communication:

- Added `corsheaders` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Added `CorsMiddleware` at the top of middleware stack
- Configured CORS settings based on environment (DEV/PROD)
- Set `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True` for JWT authentication

## 6. Added API Documentation

Set up Swagger/ReDoc documentation:

- Added `drf_yasg` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Created `core/views.py` with `schema_view` configuration
- Added Swagger and ReDoc URLs (available in DEBUG mode)

## 7. Environment-Based Configuration

Set up environment-based settings:

- Created `core/constants.py` with `DEV`, `PROD`, `BRAND_NAME`, `VERSION`
- Updated `settings.py` to use `decouple` for environment variables
- Configured environment-based `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, CORS, and security settings
- Created `.env.template` with all required variables

## 8. Database Configuration

Configured database settings:

- Added `dj-database-url` for flexible database configuration
- Set up SQLite for development, PostgreSQL/MySQL via `DATABASE_URL` for production
- Added connection pooling with `conn_max_age=600`

## 9. Security Headers

Added production-ready security settings:

- HSTS configuration
- SSL redirect (production only)
- Secure cookies (production only)
- XSS protection
- CSRF trusted origins

## 10. Static and Media Files

Configured static and media file handling:

- Set `STATIC_ROOT` and `STATIC_URL`
- Configured `STATICFILES_DIRS`
- Set `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL`
- Added static/media serving in DEBUG mode

## 11. Created Landing Page

Added a simple landing page in the base app:

- Created `apps/base/templates/base/index.html` with monochromatic design
- Created `IndexView` (TemplateView) in `apps/base/views.py`
- Added root URL route in `apps/base/urls.py`

## 12. Created Example API Endpoint

Added a health check API endpoint as an example:

- Created `HealthCheckSerializer` in `apps/base/serializers.py`
- Created `HealthCheckAPIView` (APIView) in `apps/base/views.py`
- Exposed via `apps/api/urls.py` at `/api/health/`
- Demonstrates the pattern for creating and exposing APIs

## 12.1. Added JWT Token Endpoints

Added JWT token endpoints to enable authentication:

- Added `TokenObtainPairView` and `TokenRefreshView` imports to `apps/api/urls.py`
- Added `/api/token/` endpoint for obtaining access and refresh tokens
- Added `/api/token/refresh/` endpoint for refreshing access tokens
- Created `docs/authentication.md` with comprehensive authentication documentation

These endpoints allow users to authenticate and obtain JWT tokens for API access. See [docs/authentication.md](../authentication.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## 13. Code Formatting Setup

Configured code quality tools:

- Added `black>=24.4.2` and `isort>=5.13.2` to requirements
- Created `pyproject.toml` with black and isort configuration (120 char line length)
- Set up pre-commit hooks with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Added `pre-commit>=3.6.0` to requirements

## 14. Pre-commit Hooks

Set up automated code formatting:

- Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with:
  - Basic file checks (trailing whitespace, file endings, etc.)
  - Black code formatter
  - isort import sorter
- Added `pre-commit install` to `init.sh`

## 15. ERD Generation Setup

Added Entity Relationship Diagram generation:

- Added `django-extensions>=3.2.3` and `pydotplus>=2.0.2` to requirements
- Added `django_extensions` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Created `erd.sh` script to generate model diagrams
- Created `docs/design/` directory structure
- Added ERD documentation

## 16. Initialization Script

Created `init.sh` for quick project setup:

- Upgrades pip
- Installs dependencies
- Installs pre-commit hooks
- Runs database migrations

## 17. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- Main `README.md` with quick start guide
- `docs/steps/README.md` (this file) documenting the build process
- `docs/design/README.md` for ERD generation
- Updated project structure in all docs
